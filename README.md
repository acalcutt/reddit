## Quickstart (Ubuntu 24.04)

The following steps produce a development-ready environment on Ubuntu 24.04.

### 1. Create the runtime user
```bash
useradd -m -s /bin/bash tippr
```

### 2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TechIdiots-LLC/tippr.git /opt/tippr
cd /opt/tippr
```

### 3. Run the installer

Run as root, specifying the user and domain:
```bash
TIPPR_USER=tippr TIPPR_DOMAIN=tippr.local ./install-tippr.sh
```

The installer will:
- Install system dependencies
- Set up a Python virtual environment at `/home/tippr/venv`
- Configure databases (PostgreSQL, Cassandra)
- Install and configure supporting services (memcached, RabbitMQ, Zookeeper)
- Create systemd service units for the application stack

### 4. Configure DNS

Add the domain to your hosts file (on the host machine if using a VM):
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 tippr.local" >> /etc/hosts
```

### 5. Access the site

After installation completes and services start, visit `https://tippr.local` in your browser.

## Configuration Options

Customize the installation by setting environment variables before running the installer:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `TIPPR_USER` | (required) | User to run tippr as |
| `TIPPR_DOMAIN` | `tippr.local` | Domain for the site (must contain a dot) |
| `TIPPR_HOME` | `/home/$TIPPR_USER` | Base directory for install |
| `TIPPR_VENV` | `/home/$TIPPR_USER/venv` | Python virtual environment location |
| `TIPPR_PLUGINS` | `about gold` | Space-separated list of plugins to install |
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.12` | Python version to use |

Example with custom settings:
```bash
TIPPR_USER=myuser TIPPR_DOMAIN=dev.tippr.local TIPPR_PLUGINS="about gold myaddon" ./install-tippr.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Locale Errors

If you encounter locale errors during PostgreSQL database creation:
```bash
localedef -i en_US -f UTF-8 en_US.UTF-8
```

### Domain Requirements

The domain must contain a dot (e.g., `tippr.local`) as browsers don't support cookies for dotless domains like `tippr` or `localhost`.

### Service Management

Check service status:
```bash
systemctl status tippr-serve
systemctl status tippr-websockets
systemctl status tippr-activity
```

View logs:
```bash
journalctl -u tippr-serve -f
```
