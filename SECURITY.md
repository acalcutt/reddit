Like all pieces of software, tippr has bugs &ndash; and it always will. Some
of them will take the form of security vulnerabilities.

If you find a security vulnerability in tippr, please privately report it to
[security@tippr.net](mailto:security@tippr.net). We'll get back to you ASAP,
usually within 24 hours.

Once the issue is fixed, if you provide your tippr username, we'll credit your
account with a [whitehat](https://www.tippr.net/wiki/whitehat) trophy.

Thank you and good hunting.
