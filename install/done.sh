Congratulations! tippr is now installed.

The tippr application code is managed with upstart, to see what's currently
running, run

    sudo initctl list | grep tippr

Cron jobs start with "tippr-job-" and queue processors start with
"tippr-consumer-". The crons are managed by /etc/cron.d/tippr. You can
initiate a restart of all the consumers by running:

    sudo tippr-restart

or target specific ones:

    sudo tippr-restart scraper_q

See the GitHub wiki for more information on these jobs:

* https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/Cron-jobs
* https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/Services

The tippr code can be shut down or started up with

    sudo tippr-stop
    sudo tippr-start

And if you think caching might be hurting you, you can flush memcache with

    tippr-flush

Now that the core of tippr is installed, you may want to do some additional
steps:

* Ensure that $TIPPR_DOMAIN resolves to this machine.

* To populate the database with test data, run:

    cd $TIPPR_SRC/tippr
    tippr-run scripts/inject_test_data.py -c 'inject_test_data()'

* Manually run tippr-job-update_reddits immediately after populating the db
  or adding your own subreddits.
